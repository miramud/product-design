## PRODUCT DESIGN PROJECTS:
### 1. Glade project: 
https://www.figma.com/file/OkM6OT1TGouSdFDexP7G4v/GLADE-2?node-id=0%3A1 
This project is one of CVSpan's major projects, AND I in collaboration with two other senior product designers worked on it. Please note that this project was done under NDA. Hence, I cannot leave every aspect of this project in the link.
### 2.	OleOle project: 
https://www.figma.com/file/Px5SKsVDFduHDvfZetKyxP/ole-ole-project?node-id=0%3A1 
The project was designed according to what was specified in the PRD of the client. I, in collaboration with two other designers, worked on this project.
### 3.	NewCourtland project: 
https://www.figma.com/file/tUZujaWWYpePxWaL0HtJeg/NEW-COURTLAND?node-id=0%3A1
This project was done solely by me. I designed it according to the specifications given in the PRD. I was not given a particular colour palette, so I had to create the components of the design using the client's website colour scheme, and the client was excited when he saw how I effectively captured the idea on the PRD, including the usage of the website's theme colours.
### 4.	Greenfield Puppy project: 
https://www.figma.com/file/SfAMKKnUrzUjlCSGizQ9Fv/greenfield-puppy?node-id=0%3A1
The project was designed entirely by me, and everything was according to what the client explained. The client's website also came in handy for the creation of this product's style components and design system. I struggled a bit in capturing what the client wanted for the navbar, but I was able to break through by researching and comparing it with existing applications.
### 5.	Wallet app: 
https://www.figma.com/file/0vqragLpZM1sYyTOBeM6rz/REPLICATED-WALLET?node-id=0%3A1
As part of my learning and development, I replicated an already existing E-wallet application.
